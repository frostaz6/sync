# Changelog

All notable changes to **ReSync** are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

> **Lineage.** ReSync is a revival of the discontinued, closed-source app *Sync for Reddit*
> (by Laurence Dawson, last released as v23.06.30 in 2023 and abandoned after Reddit shut off
> third-party API access). This changelog begins at the revival; the original app's history is
> not included. Everything in `1.0.0` describes how ReSync differs from that final original build.

## [Unreleased]

Nothing yet.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- **Missing post thumbnails in the card list views** (Compact / Smaller cards / Small cards). Reddit now
  returns HTML-escaped signed thumbnail URLs; left as-is, the escaped query string made the image CDN
  reject the request, so posts fell back to a plain type icon with no preview image. Thumbnails now load
  correctly. ([#1](https://github.com/X-15/ReSync/issues/1))

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-22

First public release. The original app no longer functioned — its Reddit API key, image/preview
proxy, "Ultra" cloud backend, and in-app billing were all dead. ReSync rebuilds the app from clean
source and makes it work again entirely client-side, with the tracking and monetization removed.

### Added

- **Working sign-in.** A new login flow that authenticates against current Reddit and supports normal
  account features again (2FA/SSO accounts included). The original app's login no longer worked.
- **Anonymous / logged-out browsing.** Logged-out users can now read the front page, subreddit feeds,
  and search instead of hitting an error.
- **"Sign in" action in the toolbar overflow**, so login is reachable in the default casual layout
  (which has no navigation drawer).
- **Reddit Chat.** Built-in chat support. A "Chat" action appears in *More actions* when signed in and
  opens the rooms list and message threads.
- **Inline forum-style quote cards.** Reddit permalinks inside comments and self-text now render as
  collapsible cards showing the linked post/comment inline (author, subreddit, score, comment count,
  a clamped body, tap to expand, long-press to open the full thread) instead of plain links.
- **Client-side website/link previews.** The "website preview" boxes in comments and self-text work
  again via Open Graph (`og:image`) extraction with a real-WebView screenshot fallback, replacing the
  dead Sync image proxy. Favicons are rejected so a site icon isn't upscaled into a blur. Previews of
  the first ~40 comments are prefetched when a thread opens, so they appear already-loaded.
- **Bundled privacy policy & terms.** A local `legal.html` (privacy + terms for an unofficial Reddit
  client) replaces the original's dead iubenda link (`404`).
- **Developer Options are always visible** (previously gated behind specific developer usernames).

### Changed

- **Authentication backend** was replaced so the app works against current Reddit; the existing
  `oauth.reddit.com` REST layer is reused unchanged.
- **Username resolution.** The real username is now resolved at login, with a silent
  self-heal migration for installs that had stored a placeholder value.
- **Imgur albums/images** repointed from the dead `images.syncforreddit.com` proxy directly to the
  Imgur API.
- **RedGifs playback** rewritten to read the public `/ifr/<id>` embed page's `og:video` tag, because
  RedGifs changed their API (the old `urls.hd`/`urls.sd` fields are gone). The old token→IP→gif
  request chain was removed.
- **Unfetchable previews show nothing.** Website-preview and quote spans now start collapsed and
  expand only once content loads; a `404` / missing image / failed screenshot shows the plain link
  with no box, instead of a broken-image placeholder.
- **Preview work runs off a dedicated thread pool** so multi-second `og:image`/screenshot resolution
  no longer starves normal image loading.
- **Rebranded "Sync" → "ReSync"** across onboarding, settings, notifications, and preset names. The
  verb "sync" (comments / hidden posts / offline) was deliberately kept.
- **Application ID changed** from `com.laurencedawson.reddit_sync` to `com.resync.app` (so ReSync
  installs as its own app alongside anything else). The Reddit User-Agent updated to match.
- **GitHub-hosted artwork is now bundled in the APK** instead of hot-loaded from the original author's
  repository.
- **The original "Sync shuts down June 30 2023" notice** is no longer shown.

### Fixed

- **Native video and image-viewer crash** (`ArithmeticException: divide by zero`) when opening any
  video — caused by integer-division casts the decompiler had dropped. Restored across all affected
  sites.
- **Previews collapsing to blank on narrower screens** (e.g. Galaxy S23) from six more dropped
  float-casts causing integer-division height collapse.
- **Profile button returning 404/400** — fixed by resolving the real username at login.
- **Comment overflow ("3-dots") menu crash** (`Resources$NotFoundException`) — stale inlined resource
  IDs re-symbolized so they survive a rebuild.
- **Every bottom sheet crashing on Android 15** (`view is not associated with BottomSheetBehavior`) —
  fixed by disabling forced edge-to-edge on the Material theme overlays.
- **Gallery crash on close** (`FragmentManager has been destroyed`) under the newer SDK lifecycle.
- **Overflow menu crash on Android 16** (`GradientDrawable cannot be cast to AnimatedVectorDrawable`) —
  restored the 8 real animated checkbox drawables the original's resource shrinker had stubbed out.
- **Image-viewer "Direct" share** not opening the Android share sheet.
- **Account avatar and other features silently not working** — several reflective lookups baked into
  the decompiled source used stale minified names that failed against the real libraries; all fixed.
- **Infinite-scroll pagination** never loading page 2.
- **Reddit video downloads saving audio-only** files (case-sensitive DASH track matching after Reddit
  renamed the tracks).
- **Empty Inbox "Unread"/DMs** tabs (a null-handling crash) and an **intermittent image-viewer
  slide-to-close crash**.
- **Literal `null` text appearing in quote cards** (Android `optString` returning the string "null").

### Removed

- **All advertising** — the Amazon and AdMob/GMS ad SDKs, OMSDK, and every ad code path and consent
  flow.
- **In-app billing / purchasing** — the entire purchase, restore, and "remove ads / upgrade" surface,
  plus the billing dependency.
- **"Ultra" is unlocked for free** — all local premium features (previews, comment translation, AMP
  bypass, custom paints/tags, etc.) work without a purchase.
- **Crash reporting (Crashlytics)** and the unused **analytics** dependency.
- **Dead "Ultra cloud" calls** — license-confirm, catalog-download, and cloud backup/restore/delete
  that hit Sync's dead backend (and hung or errored) are neutralized and their UI hidden.
- **Original author identity** (`ljdawson` credits, dev badge, profile link, error-text mentions).
- **Dead request chains and stale baked-in artifacts** (the old RedGifs token/IP requests; stale ART
  baseline profiles carried in the original APK).

### Security

- **No telemetry.** With crash reporting and analytics removed, the app no longer reports crash or
  usage data. The bundled policy documents a no-data-collection, on-device-storage posture.
- **No third-party proxy dependency.** Previews, Imgur, and RedGifs were re-implemented to talk
  directly to `reddit.com`, `api.imgur.com`, and `redgifs.com`, removing all reliance on Sync's
  discontinued proxy hosts — and adding no new intermediary.
- **API keys stripped from source.** The published source contains no third-party API keys (the
  original app's keys are replaced with `YOUR_*` placeholders); see the README.

### Under the hood

*The original app shipped only as an obfuscated APK. These foundational changes made a readable,
buildable, modern project exist at all — not end-user-facing, but they are the bulk of the work.*

- **Reverse-engineered the release APK into a clean, buildable Gradle project** (`./gradlew
  assembleDebug`), decompiled with jadx and cross-checked against a Vineflower second pass.
- **Fully deobfuscated** every package, class, method, field, local variable, and anonymous class
  across the whole source tree — from ~4,500 obfuscated methods and ~5,200 fields down to zero — using
  descriptor-matching against the real libraries to recover ~11,000 names.
- **Replaced all decompiled library code with real Maven artifacts** (~88 dependencies at the original
  versions: AndroidX, Glide, ExoPlayer, Material, OkHttp, Volley, Otto, etc.), so you read the *app*,
  not decompiled libraries. A few Sync-modified libraries are kept as vendored source.
- **Upgraded the toolchain:** `compileSdk`/`targetSdk` 33 → 35, AGP 8.6, Gradle 8.7, JDK 17, with
  Android 14/15/16 compatibility fixes. Verified running on Galaxy S8 and S23.
- **Resource-pipeline and build hardening:** removed colliding duplicate framework attributes, fixed
  stale resource-ID literals, characterized the resource-shrinker drawable "tombstones" as harmless,
  and produce a non-debuggable build with a clean strict-dex merge.
