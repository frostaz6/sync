# Building ReSync

This guide covers building ReSync from source, including the optional third-party API keys that were
stripped from this repository.

## Prerequisites

- **JDK 17** (the build targets Java 17).
- **Android SDK** with:
  - Platform / `compileSdk` **35**
  - Build-tools **34+**
- A `local.properties` file in the repo root pointing at your SDK, e.g.:
  ```properties
  sdk.dir=C:\\Android\\Sdk          # Windows
  # sdk.dir=/home/you/Android/Sdk   # Linux
  # sdk.dir=/Users/you/Library/Android/sdk   # macOS
  ```
  (`local.properties` is git-ignored — it's machine-specific.)

## Build

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
# -> app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

The output APK is **debug-signed** (Gradle's auto-generated debug keystore). That's fine for
sideloading. If you publish your own builds and want users to be able to update in place, create a
stable release keystore and add a `signingConfig` — otherwise each machine's debug key differs and
installs collide on signature mismatch.

The app installs as `com.resync.app` (minSdk 23 / Android 6.0+).

## API keys

The original app's third-party keys are **not** included in this repository — they're replaced with
`YOUR_*` placeholder strings. **The app builds and the core Reddit experience works without changing
anything** (browsing, comments, voting, search, media, RedGifs, and chat all work through the app's
own sign-in, which needs no key). The keys below only re-enable a few optional integrations.

To add a key, open the listed file(s) and replace the placeholder string with your value.

| Placeholder | Needed for | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| `YOUR_YOUTUBE_DATA_API_KEY` | In-app YouTube playback | Optional |
| `YOUR_IMGUR_CLIENT_ID` | Imgur album/image viewing | Optional |
| `YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY` | Imgur **uploads** | Optional |
| `YOUR_REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` | Legacy Reddit OAuth login | **Not needed** (app uses a different sign-in) |

### YouTube Data API key

Without it, YouTube links open in the external YouTube app instead of the in-app player.

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create (or pick) a project.
2. **APIs & Services → Library →** enable **"YouTube Data API v3"**.
3. **APIs & Services → Credentials → Create credentials → API key.** (Optionally restrict it to the
   YouTube Data API and to your app's package + signing certificate.)
4. Replace `YOUR_YOUTUBE_DATA_API_KEY` in:
   - `app/src/main/java/com/resync/app/ui/activities/CustomYouTubeVideoActivity.java` (2 occurrences)
   - `app/src/main/java/com/resync/app/dialogs/UrlSelectionDialogBottomSheet.java`

### Imgur Client-ID

Without it, Imgur albums/images won't load via the Imgur API.

1. Register an application at <https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient>.
2. Choose **"OAuth 2 authorization without a callback URL"** (anonymous usage — you only need the
   **Client ID**, not the secret).
3. Replace `YOUR_IMGUR_CLIENT_ID` in:
   - `app/src/main/java/com/resync/app/net/thirdparty/ImgurGalleryRequest.java`
   - `app/src/main/java/com/resync/app/net/thirdparty/ImgurSingleImageRequest.java`
   - `app/src/main/java/com/resync/app/net/thirdparty/UploadImgurRequest.java`

### RapidAPI key (Imgur uploads only)

Only needed if you want to **upload** images to Imgur from the app. The upload path goes through the
Imgur API hosted on RapidAPI.

1. Sign up at <https://rapidapi.com/>, then subscribe to the **Imgur** API
   (`imgur-apiv3.p.rapidapi.com`).
2. Copy your RapidAPI key (`X-RapidAPI-Key`).
3. Replace `YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY` in:
   - `app/src/main/java/com/resync/app/net/thirdparty/UploadImgurRequest.java`

### Reddit OAuth client ID — not required

`YOUR_REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` in `app/src/main/java/com/resync/app/auth/OAuthLoginHelper.java` is part of the
**legacy** OAuth-app login flow, which Reddit retired. ReSync uses a different sign-in path instead, so
this is unused — you can leave the placeholder as-is.

### Firebase — not required

The original app's `google-services.json` and Firebase keys are intentionally absent. The Firebase
backend (push, remote config, "Ultra" cloud) is dead, and the app runs fine without it. You do **not**
need to add Firebase config to build or use ReSync.
